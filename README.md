# Simulation platform for Acoustic Levitation Traps (SALT)
#### A configurable implementation of a matrix method to approximate the pressure field in acoustic levitation devices

## How to use SALT:

#### 1. Install python
SALT was tested in a virtual environment using python 3.7.4, its only dependencies are ```matplotlib``` and ```numpy```.

#### 2. Clone this repo
Use github desktop and copy-paste the URL of this repo or just download the zip-file manually.

## What's left?
Among many things that can be added are:

Convex shape arrays
Square/rectangular arrays with novel arrangement patterns
