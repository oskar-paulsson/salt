# Simulation platform for Acoustic Levitation Traps (SALT)
#### A configurable implementation of a matrix method to approximate the pressure field in acoustic levitation devices

## How to use SALT:

### Installation
#### 1. Install python
SALT was tested in a virtual environment using python 3.7.4, its only dependencies are ```matplotlib``` and ```numpy```.

#### 2. Clone this repo
Use github desktop and copy-paste the URL of this repo or just download the zip-file manually.

#### 3. Launch the application
Launch the application by running the file ```main.py```, simply by double clicking the file or navigating to the folder where it is located in and typing ```python main.py``` in your command prompt or terminal.
